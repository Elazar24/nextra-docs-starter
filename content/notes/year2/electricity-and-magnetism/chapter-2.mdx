Consider the following 2 situations:

1. Rubbing a **plastic** rod with a piece of **fur**.

2. Rubbing a **glass** rod with a piece of **silk**.

In the first case, <DefinitionTooltip definition="the elementry negative charge">electrons</DefinitionTooltip> are transfered from the fur to the rod, the plastic rod becomes **negatively charged**.

In the second case, electrons are transfered from the glass rod to the silk, the rod becomes **positively charged**.
